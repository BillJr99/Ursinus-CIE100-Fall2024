In this writing prompt, you will consider the questions below and write a 1-2 paragraph that thoughtfully reflects upon them.  Provide your thoughts or opinions about the topic, along with a quote or two from the text that reinforces your point of view.  Consider also what a counter-argument or alternative viewpoint might be, and briefly discuss that as well.  Provide a quote that illustrates this alternative viewpoint, or a quote that might contradict this alternative viewpoint.

## Writing Prompt

1. Confucius speaks about the role of a "gentleman" or "junzi" in society, someone who leads by moral example. Consider someone in your life or in public life who embodies these qualities. How do they influence those around them, and how does their leadership compare to Confucian ideals?

2. Confucius often discusses the concept of "Li" (ritual propriety) and its role in maintaining social harmony. Reflect on a ritual or tradition in your life. How does it contribute to your sense of order, community, or personal growth?
