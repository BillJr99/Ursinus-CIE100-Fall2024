  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 10:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  Assignments will be accepted without prior permission following this time with a points deduction of 8% per day if submitted before 10:59 PM Eastern Time on the day submitted.  Students may waive this policy up to three times during the semester for an extension of up to 7 days each; to elect this option, students must arrange this extension with the instructor at least 24 hours prior to the initial deadline.  Extra credit will not be awarded for assignments submitted under the flexible submission policy.  Students with accommodations will receive additional &quot;slack days&quot; as specified within the accommodations letter; however, some deliverables cannot be subject to accommodations due to the time-sensitive nature of the assignment (for example, group assignments, presentations, and course surveys).  Students who add the class late shall receive additional slack days equal to the number of days between the start of classes and the first date that approval is given or that class is attended (whichever occurs first).  Under no circumstances (including accommodations) can late work be accepted after the final class meeting, nor during final exams week, nor after the exam."

## The Common Intellectual Experience (CIE 100) \[[^1]\]

The [Common Intellectual Experience](https://www.ursinus.edu/academics/common-intellectual-experience/) is a two-semester course for all first year students that brings academic inquiry to bear on the central questions of a liberal education: What should matter to me? How should we live together? How can we understand the world? What will I do? Students engage in conversation about a common set of works drawn from diverse historical contexts, cultures and beliefs, selected to prompt thoughtful examination of the central questions of the course. Through this conversation the course accomplishes its goals: to cultivate the self-knowledge necessary to live a considered, independent, and responsible life; and to establish an intellectual community enjoyed by students and faculty alike. 

The course fosters the essential skills of critical reading, careful interpretation, effective discussion, clear writing, and the use of evidence to construct a compelling argument. Enrollment in CIE classes is limited to 16 students to provide an atmosphere conducive to intellectual challenge and discovery. The engagement of all students and faculty from all disciplines, the shared syllabus, and the occasional gathering of the entire class for common events allow students to confront as a community the enduring issues of our existence. 

In this course you should expect to encounter people of racial, ethnic, spiritual, economic, sexual, etc. backgrounds different from your own. Be prepared to voice your ideas and analysis in a respectful manner and support them with clear evidence. This is especially important in the current circumstances. Should circumstances require us to meet remotely, or to wear masks while in class, we will not be able to see each other clearly; accurately detect body language or facial expressions; or understand tone as easily. If you think that something is inappropriate, rude, or disrespectful, you have the right to say so. Some students may not feel comfortable addressing such problems head on. In that case, you should contact me to discuss the problem. Of course, students and even faculty with the best intentions may offend without meaning to, and it is important that we be constructive as we call attention to problems. We will work together as a class to resolve any disputes that may arise and restore a healthy learning environment.  

CIE is a four-credit course that meets for three hours each week. The additional semester hour is accounted for by attendance at the required common events; the quantity of required reading—including reading prior to the start of the semester; and the focus on revision for each of the required papers.

If you encounter barriers to learning in this course, or if you are struggling to keep up with paper due dates, do not hesitate to discuss them with me. The Institute for Student Success also works with students who have any kind of disability—whether apparent or non-apparent; learning; emotional; physical; or cognitive—and need accommodations to increase their access to this learning environment. I encourage you to reach out to the Director of Disability and Access. Contact them via email **disabilityandaccess@ursinus.edu** as soon as possible to discuss academic accommodations and/or services. If you experience something that does not fall within the established bounds of "reasonable accommodations," see me as soon as possible so that we can create the conditions that help you produce your best work.

### **Demonstration of Learning Goals**

1.  Students will develop habits of self-reflection about what matters
    to them. *They will demonstrate this by*:
    -   articulating their own stances and values on issues related to
        course discussion;
    -   expressing willingness to question their own assumptions and
        take intellectual risks; and
    -   exhibiting curiosity about the reasons behind, consequences of,
        and connections between their own ideas, values, and life
        experiences.

2.  Students will become active participants in a campus intellectual
    community. *They will demonstrate this by:*

    -   expressing appreciation for and engagement with multiple
        perspectives on any given problem, question, or topic; and
    -   showing openness to discussion of complex and/or sensitive
        topics in a setting where disagreement is likely.

3.  Students will become better critical readers of texts from a wide
    range of disciplines, cultures and time periods. *They will
    demonstrate this by:*

    -   asking questions of texts and
    -   actively engaging with authors\' ideas, language, and arguments.

4.  Students will become more skilled participants in group discussions.
    *They will demonstrate this by:*

    -   participating actively in discussions that touch on sensitive
        questions or questions of basic values and submitting their
        views to the scrutiny of their peers;
    -   clearly presenting their own ideas and arguments;
    -   listening thoughtfully and respectfully to the ideas of others;
        and
    -   considering, questioning, and responding creatively to the
        themes and topics of class discussion.

5.  Students will become better writers. *They will demonstrate this
    by:*

    -   constructing clear, articulate, and compelling arguments and
        ideas;
    -   developing a creative and original voice in writing;
    -   showing an understanding of the texts through thoughtful
        analysis and effective use of the readings to support their
        arguments and ideas;
    -   exploring the Core Curriculum questions in creative and
        meaningful ways; and
    -   taking part in a substantive drafting and revision process.

bookstore. Those marked with an \* can be found in the CIE 100 Course

opportunities on campus. Please contact the CIE Chair, [Diane
Skorina](https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/382-diane-skorina), if
you need assistance.

### **Writing Fellow**
Our class is most fortunate to have the opportunity to work with a Writing Fellow.  
Writing Fellows are highly qualified 
undergraduates trained in how to teach and tutor writing.  You will meet with your
writing fellow twice during the semester.  The writing fellow will read and consult 
with you on two of your essays.  You will reflect on these meetings in formal 
follow-up assignments.  
In addition, you will have time to (and be expected to) revise your essay
drafts in light of the feedback you receive from both your writing fellow and from the instructor.

### **Attendance and Class Engagement**
A significant component of this class is the reflective discussions that we
will have as a group, to share our diverse perspectives on the readings with which
we engage throughout the semester.  As such it is imperative that you both **attend**
and **thoughtfully engage with** these discussions and class activities.  You may 
miss up to three classes during the semester; you do not need prior permission or any stated reason for doing so.
Subsequent absences will result in a grade reduction of 30% (per the class participation grade component).

### Common Events 

-   CIE Common Events are **mandatory** for all CIE
    students.
-   If CIE faculty are not able to attend an event, they may ask for
    help in taking attendance at the event to ensure that their students
    are in attendance.
-   Some events have multiple presentation times. Closer to the events,
    CIE faculty will be asked for preferences as to which times work
    best for their classes.
-   We encourage CIE faculty to incorporate the content of the CIE
    Common Events into the classroom (for instance: short written
    assignment, classroom discussions, etc.)
-   Confirmation of location sites is still being worked out. Specific
    details about each event will be sent to all CIE students and
    faculty prior to the event.

After a brief in-class introduction to Nina Katchadourian’s Sorted Books Project, pairs of students and pairs of faculty will be assigned a specific section of the library and given a portion of time to survey, choose, and create a sequence of book titles that relate in a poetic or narrative way. Students will then copy the text from the spine/cover of the books onto stickers that will be installed in a "stack" on the endcap of the library aisles or "stacks". This project will introduce the concept of visually representing the output of a collective and provide a springboard for discussion of Katie Merz’s Live the Questions.

#### SUPPLEMENTAL RECORDINGS

*Links to the following will be made available to you through email when applicable*:

**Discussion / Robert Alter, Genesis translator**

> Stream online anytime between Monday, September 3 - Friday, October 4 
> In 2022, Ursinus hosted Robert Alter, translator of Genesis, to speak with us about his work. This virtual salon, titled Bible Remix: A Return to the Beginning (Genesis),was an open discussion that engaged the themes and texts of both semesters of the CIE. Dr. Alter gave a brief talk positioning Genesis in relation to the overarching themes of CIE. This was followed by a Q&A from faculty, staff, and students. We recorded this unique event and will make it available to students this semester as they read Alter’s work for class.

> Stream online anytime between Thursday, November 14 and Monday, December 2 
> In His Own Words: Ta-Nehisi Coates will include sections of Coates’ video interviews and speeches, in addition to readings of his work. The goal is to give you a fuller sense of Coates’ writing history, his motivation and intent for writing, and his thoughts on Between the World and Me. The recording will provide more context about the author of Between the World and Me as you are reading his work.
