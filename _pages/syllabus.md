  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 10:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  Assignments will be accepted without prior permission following this time with a points deduction of 4% per day if submitted before 10:59 PM Eastern Time on the day submitted.  Each student will receive a total of 10 &quot;slack days&quot; for the semester with which to waive these grade reductions; for example, one assignment may be submitted 10 days late, or two assignments may be submitted 5 days late, with no grade reduction.  Should an exemption to this policy be requested and granted, a 5% per day reduction will be applied.  Extra credit will not be awarded for assignments submitted under the flexible submission policy.  Students with accommodations will receive additional &quot;slack days&quot; as specified within the accommodations letter; however, some deliverables cannot be subject to accommodations due to the time-sensitive nature of the assignment (for example, group assignments, presentations, and course surveys).  Students who add the class late shall receive additional slack days equal to the number of days between the start of classes and the first date that approval is given or that class is attended (whichever occurs first).  Under no circumstances (including accommodations) can late work be accepted after the final class meeting, nor during final exams week, nor after the exam."

## The Common Intellectual Experience (CIE 100) \[[^1]\]

The [Common Intellectual Experience](https://www.ursinus.edu/academics/common-intellectual-experience/) is a two-semester course for all
first year students that brings academic inquiry to bear on the central
questions of a liberal education: What should matter to me? How should
we live together? How can we understand the world? What will I do?
Students engage in conversation about a common set of works drawn from
diverse historical contexts, cultures and beliefs, selected to prompt
thoughtful examination of the central questions of the course. Through
this conversation the course accomplishes its goals: to cultivate the
self-knowledge necessary to live a considered, independent, and
responsible life; and to establish an intellectual community enjoyed by
students and faculty alike.

The course fosters the essential skills of critical reading, careful
interpretation, effective discussion, clear writing, and the use of
evidence to construct a compelling argument. Enrollment in CIE classes
is limited to 16 students to provide an atmosphere conducive to
intellectual challenge and discovery. The engagement of all students and
faculty from all disciplines, the shared syllabus, and the occasional
gathering of the entire class for common events allow students to
confront as a community the enduring issues of our existence.

In this course you should expect to encounter people of racial, ethnic,
spiritual, economic, sexual, etc. backgrounds different from your own.
Be prepared to voice your ideas and analysis in a respectful manner and
support them with clear evidence. This is especially important in the
current circumstances. Should circumstances require us to meet remotely,
or to wear masks while in class, we will not be able to see each other
clearly; accurately detect body language or facial expressions;
or understand tone as easily. If you think that something is
inappropriate, rude, or disrespectful, you have the right to
say so. Some students may not feel comfortable addressing such problems
head on. In that case, you should contact me to discuss the problem. Of
course, students and even faculty with the best intentions may offend
without meaning to, and it is important that we be constructive as we
call attention to problems. We will work together as a class to resolve
any disputes that may arise and restore a healthy learning
environment.  

CIE is a four-credit course that meets for three hours each week. The
additional semester hour is accounted for by attendance at the required
common events; the quantity of required reading---including reading
prior to the start of the semester; and the focus on revision for each
of the required papers.

If you encounter barriers to learning in this course, or if you are
struggling to keep up with paper due dates, do not hesitate to discuss
them with me. The Institute for Student Success also works with students
who have any kind of disability---whether apparent or non-apparent;
learning; emotional; physical; or cognitive---and need accommodations to
increase their access to this learning environment. I encourage you to
reach out to the Director of Disability and Access, Dr. Dee Singley to
discuss supports and accommodations you may need. Dee's office is in the
UCARE Suite in Myrin Library. You can schedule a meeting with Dee by
using this link <https://dsingley.youcanbook.me/>; by emailing her at
<dsingley@ursinus.edu>; or by calling her at 1-484-762-4329. Students
can also review accessibility and disabilities services online at
<https://ursinus.edu/offices/disability-and-access/>.

### **Learning goals**

1.  Students will develop habits of self-reflection about what matters
    to them. *They will demonstrate this by*:

    -   articulating their own stances and values on issues related to
        course discussion;

    -   expressing willingness to question their own assumptions and
        take intellectual risks; and

    -   exhibiting curiosity about the reasons behind, consequences of,
        and connections between their own ideas, values, and life
        experiences.

2.  Students will become active participants in a campus intellectual
    community. *They will demonstrate this by:*

    -   expressing appreciation for and engagement with multiple
        perspectives on any given problem, question, or topic; and

    -   showing openness to discussion of complex and/or sensitive
        topics in a setting where disagreement is likely.

3.  Students will become better critical readers of texts from a wide
    range of disciplines, cultures and time periods. *They will
    demonstrate this by:*

    -   asking questions of texts and

    -   actively engaging with authors\' ideas, language, and arguments.

4.  Students will become more skilled participants in group discussions.
    *They will demonstrate this by:*

    -   participating actively in discussions that touch on sensitive
        questions or questions of basic values and submitting their
        views to the scrutiny of their peers;

    -   clearly presenting their own ideas and arguments;

    -   listening thoughtfully and respectfully to the ideas of others;
        and

    -   considering, questioning, and responding creatively to the
        themes and topics of class discussion.

5.  Students will become better writers. *They will demonstrate this
    by:*

    -   constructing clear, articulate, and compelling arguments and
        ideas;

    -   developing a creative and original voice in writing;

    -   showing an understanding of the texts through thoughtful
        analysis and effective use of the readings to support their
        arguments and ideas;

    -   exploring the Core Curriculum questions in creative and
        meaningful ways; and

    -   taking part in a substantive drafting and revision process.

*The following texts are required and should be purchased at the campus
bookstore. Those marked with an \* can be found in the CIE 100 Course
Reader, which should be purchased at the campus bookstore.*

The college recognizes that temporary financial hardships can impact
students\' access to course materials, as well as their access to
opportunities on campus. Please contact the CIE Chair, [Diane
Skorina](https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/382-diane-skorina), if
you need assistance.

### **Writing Fellow**
Our class will work with a Writing Fellow.  Writing Fellows are highly qualified 
undergraduates trained in how to teach and tutor writing.  You will meet with your
writing fellow twice during the semester.  The writing fellow will read and consult 
with you on two of your essays.  You will reflect on these meetings in formal 
follow-up assignments.  In addition, you will have time to (and be expected to) revise your essay
drafts in light of the feedback you receive from both your writing fellow and from the instructor.

### **Attendance and Class Engagement**
A significant component of this class is the reflective discussions that we
will have as a group, to share our diverse perspectives on the readings with which
we engage throughout the semester.  As such it is imperative that you both **attend**
and **thoughtfully engage with** these discussions and class activities.  You may 
miss up to three classes during the semester; you do not need prior permission or any stated reason for doing so.
Subsequent absences will result in a grade reduction of 30% (per the class participation grade component).

### Common Events 

-   CIE Common Events are **mandatory** for all CIE
    students.

-   If CIE faculty are not able to attend an event, they may ask for
    help in taking attendance at the event to ensure that their students
    are in attendance.

-   Some events have multiple presentation times. Closer to the events,
    CIE faculty will be asked for preferences as to which times work
    best for their classes.

-   We encourage CIE faculty to incorporate the content of the CIE
    Common Events into the classroom (for instance: short written
    assignment, classroom discussions, etc.)

-   Confirmation of location sites is still being worked out. Specific
    details about each event will be sent to all CIE students and
    faculty prior to the event.

*Links to the following will be made available to you through email when applicable*:

**Discussion / Robert Alter, Genesis translator**

Stream online anytime between Monday, Oct 2 and Friday, Oct. 6 

In 2021, Ursinus hosted Robert Alter, translator of Genesis, to speak
with us about his work. This virtual salon, titled "Bible Remix: A
Return to the Beginning (Genesis)," was an open discussion that engaged
the themes and texts of both semesters of the CIE. Dr. Alter gave a
brief talk positioning Genesis in relation to the overarching themes of
CIE. This was followed by a Q&A from faculty, staff, and students. We
recorded this unique event and will make it available to students this
semester as they read Alter's work for class. 

**In His Own Words: Ta-Nehisi Coates**

Stream online anytime between Wednesday, November 15 and Friday, Dec 1 

"In His Own Words: Ta-Nehisi Coates" will include sections of Coates'
video interviews and speeches, in addition to readings of his work. The
goal is to give you a fuller sense of Coates' writing history, his
motivation and intent for writing, and his thoughts on *Between the
World and Me*. The recording will provide more context about the author
of *Between the World and Me* as you are reading his work.
